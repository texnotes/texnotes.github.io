==================

**JSportfolio** is a small widget written in JavaScript, 
which provide to demonstrate the JS-code. 

This project began as small implementation of idea @podgorniy under School of JavaScript. 
In my plans is improvement of the project. It’s for fun and in the direction of unit-testing. 
Yet the earliest plans are redesign of the interface and code cleanup.
